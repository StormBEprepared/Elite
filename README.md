Hello. This is a financial helping application developed using winforms, c# and microsoft sql server.
For this project I used the local database in microsoft sql server in which I created three different tables as follows: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96778964/169671805-ee6dd8a6-c30f-4d89-9e34-38795b797c2e.png)

The app is configured to have a login page where you can also register: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96778964/169671627-6763db98-e046-404b-aa43-20455655ad1a.png)


After successfull login the page should look like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96778964/169671645-f25326a7-0d6c-4a6a-b681-5076802a68a6.png)

On the Savings and Spendings pages you should be able to see the total amound saved and spent by the logged user and the controls for adding/ changing these values from database:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96778964/169671850-8952732f-7612-4451-97c9-1caddda3d01e.png)

The Journal page lets you write some thoughts and save them as a txt file with the current day as the file name in a selected folder:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96778964/169671876-246f75f3-56f5-4ac6-90fc-6163b2a63684.png)
If you try to save multiple notes on the same day the existing file will open and you can edit it, then save it.
The charts and targets tabs are free for future ideas implementations these being non-operational.
